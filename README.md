# Priority Evaluator
This repo provides the code for the implementation of an online, survey-based carbon calculator and an online, survey-based priority evaluator, using the software Qualtrics. The carbon calculator and priority evaluator have been developed by the [Swiss Mobility Panel](https://istp.ethz.ch/research/swiss-mobility-panel.html) project team at ETH Zurich.
